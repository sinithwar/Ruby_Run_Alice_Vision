# Ruby_Run_Alice_Vision
This is a ruby translation of a command line application written in Python for the command line access of Meshroom 2018.
The original source can be found at this link http://filmicworlds.com/blog/command-line-photogrammetry-with-alicevision/
I need to run this program on Ruby for work done in Rails, therefore I've translated the command line application of run_alicevision.py into run_alice.rb.
The command line application utilizes Meshroom 2018.1.0, not the newest version, because the command line application from Python uses that. It will not work with 2019++ as it uses different commands and variables.
